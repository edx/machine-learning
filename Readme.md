Overview
---------------------
This is a repo with functions that can score arbitrary free text and numeric predictors.
This is licensed under the AGPL, please see LICENSE.txt for details.
The goal here is to provide a high-performance, scalable solution that can predict targets from arbitrary values.

Note that this is a library.  You will need to implement your own code to make it runnable.  The discern repo in
the edX github organization is an API wrapper for this code.  See http://github.com/edx/discern for more information.

We also have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edx-discern).  Feel free to ask questions and discuss the code there.  If you find an issue (unless it is a security issue, see below), please mention it on our issue tracker.
